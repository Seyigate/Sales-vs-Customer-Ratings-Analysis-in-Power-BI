🎯 **Slicer-Enabled Filtering** → Allows analysis by city, product line, and rating groups.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
🔹 **Power BI** → Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.  
🔹 **Power Query** → Data transformation & cleaning.  
🔹 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** → Custom calculations & correlation metrics.

## 📌 How to Use This Project
